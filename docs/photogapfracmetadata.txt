Canopy gap fraction estimated from canopy photography

Methods are described in detail in Duursma et al. 2015 (in press, Global Change Biology).

The photos from which these gap fractions were calculated are also on HIEv (FACE_P0037_RA_CANPHOTO...).

Variables:
  - Ring: One of six EucFACE rings (R1, R2, ..., R6) 
  - northing: coordinate inside the FACE ring (at white peg)
  - easting: coordinate inside the FACE ring (at white peg)
  - filename: unique filename (also on HIEv in zipped archives, see above)
  - threshold: threshold determined by automatic algorithm
  - gapfraction: fraction of pixels with intensity > threshold, therefore, the gap fraction of the canopy
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - treatment: elevated or ambient
