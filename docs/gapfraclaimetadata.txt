Estimates of canopy gap fraction and leaf area index for the EucFACE based on diffuse transmittance data. 

Transmittance is estimated as PAR below / PAR above the canopy, for 30min periods where the diffuse fraction > 0.98 (as estimated with the BF5 SunShine sensor at the CUP Eddy flux tower site). 

Estimates are daily averages by Ring. The number of observations varies between days, depending on the number of 30min cloudy periods.

Variables: 
  - Ring: One of six EucFACE rings (R1, R2, ..., R6) 
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD 
  - Gapfraction.mean: Daily mean gapfraction (0-1) 
  - Gapfraction.sd: within-day standard deviation of gapfraction
  - Gapfraction.length: Number of observations within a day
  - treatment: Either 'elevated' or 'ambient'
  - LAI: Inferred leaf area index (m2 m-2) using algorithm of Campbell&Norman 2000, based on the attenuation of diffuse radiation in a homogenous canopy.
