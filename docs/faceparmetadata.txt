Half-hourly radiation data for the EucFACE

This file is constructed based on radiation data in FACE_general, FACE_airvars and eddy_slowmet.
The original data is averaged by 30min timestep here (the timestamp refers to the 30min before that time).
See those collection codes for full documentation.

The variables 'source_airvars', 'source_general' and 'source_eddy' refer to the original files on HIEv that this aggregated version was constructed from.

Data for project P0037 led by Remko Duursma. Anyone can use the data if they have access.
