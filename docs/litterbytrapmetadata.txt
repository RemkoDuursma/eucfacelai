Leaf litter data collected at the EucFACE

Data owners / collectors: Kristine Crous, Andrew Gherlenda, Jeff Powell, David Ellsworth

This dataset is a subset of the complete dataset, including only the leaf portion of the litter fall, which was separated manually from other components (bark, twigs, frass, etc.).

Leaf litter is also converted to units of leaf area index (m2 m-2), using an estimate of specific leaf area (52.6 cm2 g-1; pers. comm. David Ellsworth), and the area of the litter baskets (0.1979 m2).


Variables:
  - Date: YYYY-MM-DD
  - Ring: FACE ring (R1, R2, ...,R6)
  - Leaf: leaf litter on collection date (g)
  - dLAIlitter: litter converted to units of LAI (m2 m-2)
  - treatment: 'ambient' or 'elevated'
