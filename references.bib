  Abstract                 = {Significant progress on quantifying state and trends in vegetation structure in savanna and woodland ecosystems has been made by integrating in situ measurements with lidar datasets. However, large area ground-based monitoring campaigns required for calibration are both costly to maintain, and reduce the generality of results. Estimation of directional gap probability (Pgap) from waveform lidar which is both direct (i.e. physically-based) and minimises or removes requirements for field calibration would be a significant advance for large area sampling. We present a new model for estimating Pgap from small footprint airborne waveform lidar data that accounts for differences in canopy ({\"{I}}�v) and ground ({\"{I}}�g) reflectivity and compare this new method with published discrete return lidar methods. We use lidar surveys acquired at multiple altitudes using RIEGL LMS-Q680i and RIEGL LMS-Q560 waveform systems over a savanna woodland in the Einasleigh Uplands bioregion of northern Queensland, Australia. The waveform model for Pgap was found to fit observed waveform data in cases where the assumption of constant {\"{I}}�v and {\"{I}}�g was satisfied. Pgap estimates from the waveform model were shown to be relatively insensitive to variation in sensor altitude. This was in contrast to other methods of estimating Pgap where differences up to {\textasciitilde} 0.15 Pgap have been observed. Comparison of lidar-derived Pgap with ground measurements showed the new waveform model produced estimates corresponding to within 5\% Pgap. We suggest the waveform model to retrieve {\"{I}}�v/{\"{I}}�g and Pgap is a significant advance in retrieval of canopy structure parameters from small footprint lidar, reducing the need for local calibration, and providing direct estimates of Pgap. If the assumptions of relatively stable {\"{I}}�v/{\"{I}}�g are shown to hold across a greater range of sensor, survey, and canopy structure configurations we suggest this method may have wide practical application for retrieval of Pgap.},

  Abstract                 = {Measurements of leaf area index (LAI) taken with photometers such as the LAI2000 are biased by boles and branches which stop part of the light from reaching the photometer. We estimated how much of the sky would be obscurred by boles in an immature stand of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb) Franco) that was stem-mapped and of known diameter, height and height-to-live-crown. These yielded gap fractions which were then converted to bole area index (BAI) via the algorithm used by the LAI2000. The mean BAI, as a fraction of the effective leaf area index (LAIe) calculated by the LAI2000, ranged from \&lt;0.01 for Douglas-fir at 24 years of age to about 0.1 at 48 years. Comparing readings on Douglas-fir trees defoliated by root rot with readings on fully foliated trees yielded a proportion of 0.41, which included branches. Measurements were also taken on clumps of maple (Acer macrophyllum Pursh) and alder (Alnus rubra Bong.) both before and after leaf-fall, yielding corresponding proportions, including branches, of 0.41 and 0.25, respectively. The values obtained this way are probably upper limits. The contributions of boles may be appreciable, particularly in mature unthinnned stands with closed canopies.},

  Abstract                 = {Resolving ecophysiological processes in elevated atmospheric CO2 (Ca) at scales larger than single leaves poses significant challenges. Here, we describe a field-based experimental system designed to grow trees up to 9{~}m tall in elevated Ca with the capacity to control air temperature and simultaneously measure whole-tree gas exchange. In western Sydney, Australia, we established the Hawkesbury Forest Experiment (HFE) where we built whole-tree chambers (WTC) to measure whole-tree CO2 and water fluxes of an evergreen broadleaf tree, Eucalyptus saligna. A single E. saligna tree was grown from seedling to small tree within each of 12 WTCs; six WTCs were maintained at ambient Ca and six WTCs were maintained at elevated Ca, targeted at ambient Ca +240{~}[mu]mol{~}mol-1. All 12 WTCs were controlled to track ambient outside air temperature (Tair) and air water vapour deficit (Dair). During the experimental period, Tair, Dair and Ca in the WTCs were within 0.5{~}$\deg$C, 0.3{~}kPa, and 15{~}[mu]mol{~}mol-1 of the set-points for 90\% of the time, respectively. Diurnal responses of whole-tree CO2 and water vapour fluxes are analysed, demonstrating the ability of the tree chamber system to measure rapid environmental responses of these fluxes of entire trees. The light response of CO2 uptake for entire trees showed a clear diurnal hysteresis, attributed to stomatal closure at high Dair. Tree scale CO2 fluxes confirm the hypothesised deleterious effect of chilling night-time temperatures on whole-tree carbon gain in this subtropical Eucalyptus. The whole-tree chamber flux data add an invaluable scale to measurements in both ambient and elevated Ca and allow us to elucidate the mechanisms driving tree productivity responses to elevated Ca in interaction with water availability and temperature.},

  Abstract                 = {Drought monitoring is important to analyse the influence of rainfall deficiency patterns on bushfire behaviour. Remote sensing provides tools for spatially explicit monitoring of drought across large areas. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of MODIS-based reflectance spectral indices to monitor drought across forest and woodland vegetation types in the fire prone Sydney Basin Bioregion, NSW, Australia. A time series of eight spectral indices were created from 2000 to 2009 to monitor inter-annual changes in drought and were compared to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), a precipitation deficit/surplus indicator. A pixel-to-weather station paired correlation approach was used to assess the relationship between SPI and the MODIS-based spectral indices at different time scales. Results show that the Normalised Difference Infrared Index{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}band 6 (NDIIb6) provided the most suitable indicator of drought for the high biomass vegetation types considered. The NDIIb6 had the highest sensitivity to drought intensity and was highly correlated with SPI at all time scales analysed (i.e., 1, 3 and 6-month SPI) suggesting that variations in precipitation patterns have a stronger influence on vegetation water content than vegetation greenness properties. Spatial similarities were also found between patterns of NDIIb6-based drought maps and SPI values distribution. NDIIb6 outperformed the spectral index currently in use for operational drought monitoring systems in the region (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) and its implementation in existing drought-monitoring systems is recommended.},

  Abstract                 = {Two indirect gap fraction methods for estimating leaf area index (LAI) are compared with estimates from litterfall collections in a mixed-age oak-hickory forest. One indirect method uses averaged, direct beam penetration data obtained with a moving tram. The second uses a portable light sensor system that measures diffuse light penetration for five sky sectors between zenith angles 0 and 75$\deg$. Data were collected from September 1989 to January 1990.

The Poisson model and the negative binomial model of gap frequency were applied to estimate LAI from observed transmittances. With the Poisson model, an assumption of a random leaf spatial distribution contributes to an underestimation of LAI by as much as 45\%; this is because leaves at this site are actually clumped at both large and small scales. The negative binomial, which requires determination of a clumping parameter, produces estimates comparable with those of the litterfall method.

Both indirect techniques accurately describe temporal changes in leaf area using either the Poisson or negative binomial model. The portable system also allows easy estimation of the spatial variation in leaf area within the site or between sites, and it can be used to obtain a vertical profile of leaf area.},

  Abstract                 = {The feasibility of detecting the seasonal variation in leaf area index (LAI) in boreal conifer forests is investigated using optical instruments. The LAI of six stands was measured. They include young and old jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and old black spruce (Picea mariana) located near the southern border (near Prince Albert, Saskatchewan) and near the northern border (near Thompson, Manitoba) of the Canadian boreal ecotone. LAI values of the stands are obtained by making several corrections to the effective LAI measured from the LI-COR LAI-2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer (PCA). The corrections include a foliage element (shoot) clumping index (for clumping at scales larger than the shoot) measured using the optical instrument TRAC (Tracing Radiation and Architecture of Canopies) developed by Chen and Cihlar (Chen, J.M. and Cihlar, J., 1995a, Plant canopy gap size analysis theory for improving optical measurements of leaf area index of plant canopies, Appl. Opt., 34: 6211{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}6222), a needle-to-shoot area ratio (for clumping within the shoot) obtained from shoot samples, and a woody-to-total area ratio obtained through destructive sampling of trees. It is found that the effective LAI varied about 5\% to 10\% in the growing season and the element clumping index remained almost unchanged. The needle-to-shoot area ratio varied the most, about 15\% to 25\%, which is of the same order of magnitude as the expected seasonal variability in LAI. This demonstrates that most of the seasonal variation information is contained in the needle-to-shoot area ratio, which can not be measured indirectly using in situ optical instruments and has to be obtained from a large quantity of shoot sample analysis which is laborious and error-prone. Based on our experience, an improved and convenient shoot sampling strategy is suggested for future studies. The optically-based LAI values were compared with destructive sampling results for three of the stands. Based on error analysis, we believe that optical measurements combined with shoot sample analysis can produce LAI values for conifer stands which are more accurate than destructive sampling results.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf area index (L) is a critical variable in monitoring and modelling forest condition and growth and is therefore important for foresters and environmental scientists to measure routinely and accurately. We compared three different methods for estimating L: a plant canopy analyser (PCA), a point-quadrat camera method and digital hemispherical photography at a native eucalypt forest canopy at Tumbarumba in southern New South Wales, Australia. All of these methods produced indirect estimates of L based on the close coupling between radiation penetration and canopy structure. The individual L estimates were compared, and the potential advantages and disadvantages of each method were discussed in relation to use in forest inventory and in field data collection programmes for remote sensing calibration and verification. The comparison indicated that all three methods, PCA, digital hemispherical photography and the modified point-quadrat camera method, produced similar estimates with a standard error between techniques of less than 0.2 L units. All methods, however, provided biased estimates of L and calibration is required to derive true stand L. A key benefit, however, of all of these estimation methods is that observations can be collected in a short period of time (1-2 h of field-work per plot).},

  Abstract                 = {Aims Few direct tests of phosphorus (P) limitation on highly-weathered soils have been conducted, especially in mature, native Eucalyptus stands. We tested whether growth in a mature {\textgreater}80-year old stand of Eucalyptus tereticornis in Cumberland Plain Woodland was limited by P, and whether this P-limitation affected leaf photosynthetic capacity. Methods P was added to trees at the native woodland site at 50 kg ha-1 year-1 in each of 3 years, and stem and leaf responses were measured. Results Leaf P concentrations before fertilisation were {\textless} 1 mg g-1 and N:P ratios ranged between 16 and 23. Addition of 50 kg ha-1 year-1 of P increased leaf P concentration significantly (+50 \%) compared to non-fertilised trees, for two but not for the 3 years. Despite higher leaf P in fertilised trees, photosynthetic capacity was unaffected. However, there was a 54 \% increase in tree stem basal area growth during the first and second years of P fertilisation, statistically significant in the second year of the experiment. Conclusions Our evidence shows that E. tereticornis is P-limited on Cumberland Plain soils. This has implications for forest responses to rising atmospheric [CO2], because photosynthesis in elevated [CO2] may become further constrained by required phosphate pools within the photosynthetic apparatus.},

  Abstract                 = {Canopy leaf area index (LAI), defined as the single-sided leaf area per unit ground area, is a quantitative measure of canopy foliar area. LAI is a controlling biophysical property of vegetation function, and quantifying LAI is thus vital for understanding energy, carbon and water fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. LAI is routinely available from Earth Observation (EO) instruments such as MODIS. However EO-derived estimates of LAI require validation before they are utilised by the ecosystem modelling community. Previous validation work on the MODIS collection 4 (c4) product suggested considerable error especially in forested biomes, and as a result significant modification of the MODIS LAI algorithm has been made for the most recent collection 5 (c5). As a result of these changes the current MODIS LAI product has not been widely validated. We present a validation of the MODIS c5 LAI product over a 121 km2 area of mixed coniferous forest in Oregon, USA, based on detailed ground measurements which we have upscaled using high resolution EO data. Our analysis suggests that c5 shows a much more realistic temporal LAI dynamic over c4 values for the site we examined. We find improved spatial consistency between the MODIS c5 LAI product and upscaled in situ measurements. However results also suggest that the c5 LAI product underestimates the upper range of upscaled in situ LAI measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {* Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2) has the potential to increase vegetation carbon storage if increased net primary production causes increased long-lived biomass. Model predictions of eCO2 effects on vegetation carbon storage depend on how allocation and turnover processes are represented.


* We used data from two temperate forest free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments to evaluate representations of allocation and turnover in 11 ecosystem models.


* Observed eCO2 effects on allocation were dynamic. Allocation schemes based on functional relationships among biomass fractions that vary with resource availability were best able to capture the general features of the observations. Allocation schemes based on constant fractions or resource limitations performed less well, with some models having unintended outcomes. Few models represent turnover processes mechanistically and there was wide variation in predictions of tissue lifespan. Consequently, models did not perform well at predicting eCO2 effects on vegetation carbon storage.


* Our recommendations to reduce uncertainty include: use of allocation schemes constrained by biomass fractions; careful testing of allocation schemes; and synthesis of allocation and turnover data in terms of model parameters. Data from intensively studied ecosystem manipulation experiments are invaluable for constraining models and we recommend that such experiments should attempt to fully quantify carbon, water and nutrient budgets.},

The role in this greening of the {\textquotedblleft}CO2 fertilization{\textquotedblright} effect---the enhancement of photosynthesis due to rising CO2 levels---is yet to be established. The direct CO2 effect on vegetation should be most clearly expressed in warm, arid environments where water is the dominant limit to vegetation growth. Using gas exchange theory, we predict that the 14\% increase in atmospheric CO2 (1982--2010) led to a 5 to 10\% increase in green foliage cover in warm, arid environments. Satellite observations, analyzed to remove the effect of variations in precipitation, show that cover across these environments has increased by 11\%. Our results confirm that the anticipated CO2 fertilization effect is occurring alongside ongoing anthropogenic perturbations to the carbon cycle and that the fertilization effect is now a significant land surface process.},

  Abstract                 = {This study evaluated one semi-direct and three indirect methods for estimating leaf area index (LAI) by comparing these estimates with direct estimates derived from litter collection. The semi-direct method uses a thin metallic needle to count a number of contacts across fresh litter layers. One indirect method is based on the penetration of diffuse global radiation measured over the course of a day. The second indirect method uses the LAI-2000 plant canopy analyser (PCA) which measures diffuse light penetration from five different sky sectors simultaneously. The third indirect method uses the {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}Demon{\^{a}}{\texteuro}� portable light sensor to measure the penetration of direct beam sunlight at different zenith angles over the course of half a day. The Poisson model of gap frequency was applied to estimate plant area index (PAI) from observed transmittances using the second and third methods. Litter collection from 11 temperate decidous forests gave values of LAI ranging from 1.7 to 7.5. Estimates based on the needle method showed a significant linear relationship with LAI values obtained from litter collections but were systematically lower (by 6{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}37\%). PAI estimates using all three indirect techniques (fixed light sensor system, LAI-2000 and Demon) showed a strong linear relationship with LAI derived from litter collection. Differences, averaged over all forest stands, between PAI estimates from each of the three indirect methods and LAI from litter collections were below 2\%. If we consider that LAI=PAI{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}WAI (wood area index) then, all three indirect methods underestimated LAI by an additional factor close to the value of WAI. One reason could be a local clumping of architectural canopy components: in particular, the spatial dispositions of branchlets and leaves are not independent, leading to a non-random relationship between the distributions of these two canopy components.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical variable for land surface and climate modeling studies. Several global LAI products exist, and it is important to know how these products perform and what their uncertainties are. Five major global LAI products{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}MODIS, GEOV1, GLASS, GLOBMAP, and JRC-TIP{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}were compared between 2003 and 2010 at a 0.01{\^{A}}$\deg$ spatial resolution and with a monthly time step. The daily Land-SAF product was used as a regional reference in order to evaluate the performance of other global products in Africa. Cross-sensor LAI conversion equations were derived for different biome types. Product uncertainties were assessed by looking into the product quantitative quality indicators (QQIs) attached to MODIS, GEOV1, and JRC-TIP. MODIS, GEOV1, GLASS, and GLOBMAP are generally consistent and show strong linear relationships between the products (R2 {\textgreater} 0.74), with typical deviations of {\textless} 0.5 for nonforest and {\textless} 1.0 for forest biomes. JRC-TIP, the only effective LAI product, is about half the values of the other LAI products. The average uncertainties and relative uncertainties are in the following order: MODIS (0.17, 11.5\%) {\textless} GEOV1 (0.24, 26.6\%) {\textless} Land-SAF (0.36, 37.8\%) {\textless} JRC-TIP (0.43, 114.3\%). The highest relative uncertainties usually appear in ecological transition zones. More than 75\% of MODIS, GEOV1, JRC-TIP, and Land-SAF pixels are within the absolute uncertainty requirements ({\^{A}}$\pm$ 0.5) set by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), whereas more than 78.5\% of MODIS and 44.6\% of GEOV1 pixels are within the threshold for relative uncertainty (20\%). This study reveals the discrepancies mainly due to differences between definitions, retrieval algorithms, and input data. Future product development and validation studies should focus on areas (e.g., sparsely vegetated and savanna areas) and periods (e.g., winter time) with higher uncertainties.},

  Abstract                 = {Vegetation characteristics of a watershed can be important in estimating hydrological response variables (HRVs) such as streamflow (Q), evapotranspiration (ET), and river yield (Q/P). Quantifying the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation metrics and hydrological response to precipitation (P) has the potential to facilitate prediction of HRVs for ungauged watersheds, and/or aid in the assessment of watershed similarity as an initial phase of hydrological regionalization. The utility of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data to estimate HRVs of watersheds at the regional scale (southern and central California) is tested in this study. An exhaustive statistical regression analysis was conducted to quantify the relationships between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs using both ordinary least squares and spatially varying parameter models. Additionally a confirmatory analysis was conducted to test the effect precipitation and potential evaporation have on the exploratory regression results. Results from both the exploratory and confirmatory analyses suggest that (1) while there are limitations in the water balance approach to estimating ET (errors associated with changes in storage and meteorological data are unknown), moderate statistical relationships exist between MODIS vegetation metrics and HRVs; (2) these relationships are heavily influenced by vegetation{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}precipitation relationships and general precipitation magnitudes; (3) relationships between MODIS metrics and precipitation/HRVs are strongest when drought conditions prevail; and (4) LAI has the strongest relationship with precipitation and HRVs compared to other MODIS vegetation metrics.},

Plant area index was calculated from transmittance measurements by the inversion method assuming an ellipsoidal angle distribution of uniformly distributed canopy elements, or by application of the Beer-Lambert Law using an empirically determined extinction coefficient (k) for diffuse light of 0.5. Plant area index values of the experimental plantations varied as a consequence of diffferent water and mineral nutrient application rates. The PAI estimated from biomass harvesting ranged from 1.61 to 4.04. The estimates of PAI obtained by the ellipsoidal angle distribution method were significantly different from those based on the allometric relationships or from transmittance measurements assuming a value of k for diffuse light of 0.5.},

  Abstract                 = {A primary objective of the Earth Observing System (EOS) is to develop and validate algorithms to estimate leaf area index (L), fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and net primary production (NPP) from remotely sensed products. These three products are important because they relate to or are components of the metabolism of the biosphere and can be determined for terrestrial ecosystems from satellite-borne sensors. The importance of these products in the EOS program necessitates the need to use standard methods to obtain accurate ground truth estimates of L, fAPAR, and NPP that are correlated to satellite-derived estimates. The objective of this article is to review direct and indirect methods used to estimate L, fAPAR, and NPP in terrestrial ecosystems. Direct estimates of L, biomass, and NPP can be obtained by harvesting individual plants, developing allometric equations, and applying these equations to all individuals in the stand. Using non-site-specific allometric equations to estimate L and foliage production can cause large errors because carbon allocation to foliage is influenced by numerous environmental and ecological factors. All of the optical instruments that indirectly estimate L actually estimate {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}effective{\^{a}}{\texteuro}� leaf area index (LE) and underestimate L when foliage in the canopy is nonrandomly distributed (i.e., clumped). We discuss several methods, ranging from simple to complex in terms of data needs, that can be used to correct estimates of L when foliage is clumped. Direct estimates of above-ground and below-ground net primary production (NPPA and NPPB, respectively) are laborious, expensive and can only be carried out for small plots, yet there is a great need to obtain global estimates of NPP. Process models, driven by remotely sensed input parameters, are useful tools to examine the influence of global change on the metabolism of terrestrial ecosystems, but an incomplete understanding of carbon allocation continues to hamper development of more accurate NPP models. We summarize carbon allocation patterns for major terrestrial biomes and discuss emerging allocation patterns that can be incorporated into global NPP models. One common process model, light use efficiency or epsilon model, uses remotely sensed fAPAR, light use efficiency (LUE) and carbon allocation coefficients, and other meteorological data to estimates NPP. Such models require reliable estimates of LUE. We summarize the literature and provide LUE coefficients for the major biomes, being careful to correct for inconsistencies in radiation, dry matter and carbon allocation units.},

* We assessed the role of these factors on psyllid population dynamics during the peak and decline of a Cardiaspina psyllid outbreak in a critically endangered eucalypt woodland in Australia. Initially, this involved describing the field biology and ecology of a newly reported Cardiaspina species on grey box (Eucalyptus moluccana Roxb.).

* Within 1\hspace{0.167em}year, the psyllid completed four generations. Its biology and parasitoid complex were similar to other Cardiaspina species during outbreaks.

* Minimum winter temperature was a key driver of psyllid development and density. Natural enemies did not prevent or control this outbreak.

* The outbreak resulted in area-wide and chronic defoliation of host trees. Resource depletion and summer heat waves impacting critical developmental stages of psyllids were the major factors responsible for the significant reduction of psyllid populations in early 2013. However, ongoing regeneration of trees in the highly fragmented woodlands may allow recolonization of new foliage and chronic infestations to continue.},

  Abstract                 = {A spatially explicit hydroecological landscape model of water, carbon and energy balances (Topog- IRM) is described. The landscape is envisaged as a catchment forested with a single stratum comprising {\textless}I{\textgreater}Eucalyptus maculata{\textless}/I{\textgreater} trees. The model was used to simulate the direct effects of a 2\&\#215; elevation in atmospheric carbon dioxide at two levels of nitrogen on catchment water yield, soil moisture status and tree growth. Experimental results used to parameterise the model are detailed. Key features of the model are (1) an ability to scale hydrological processes at the catchment scale in three dimensions, and (2) a means to integrate multiple factors/ stresses on plant growth.{\textless}P{\textgreater} The effects of CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ on catchment hydrology (water yield or soil moisture content) and forest growth (expressed as leaf area index, LAI) were modelled for a 2.-year period, and contrasted with the effects of added nitrogen. Results were expressed as totals for the catchment or spatially distributed across the catchment. For the total catchment, water yield increased in the order: high CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with low N, high CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with high N, ambient CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with low N, ambient Co$_{\textrm{2}}$ with high N. LAI increased from 3.3 to 5.7 in the order: ambient CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with low N, ambient CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with high N, high CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ with low N, high Co$_{\textrm{2}}$ with high N. These results agree with previous data. New findings are:{\textless}P{\textgreater} (1) with elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ a new equilibrium in transpiration is established in which leaf area increases offset decreases in stomatal conductance;{\textless}P{\textgreater} (2) the addition of nitrogen increases transpiration without any indication of a new equilibrium being reached during the simulated period;{\textless}P{\textgreater} (3) the spatial distribution of soil moisture changes, presenting a new resource base for spatial changes to species composition and growth rates.{\textless}P{\textgreater} The major hydroecological responses to elevated CO$_{\textrm{2}}$ are seen as increased maximum upper canopy leaf area, increased litter inputs, especially at times of drought (hence changed fire regimes), changes in the composition of the understorey (hence litter composition, soil microfauna, and the spatial expression of biological diversity) and a slight increase in water yield.},

  Abstract                 = {A free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) system was designed to permit the experimental exposure of tall vegetation such as stands of forest trees to elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations ([CO2]a) without enclosures that alter tree microenvironment. We describe a prototype FACE system currently in operation in forest plots in a maturing loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stand in North Carolina, USA. The system uses feedback control technology to control [CO2] in a 26{~}m diameter forest plot that is over 10{~}m tall, while monitoring the 3D plot volume to characterize the whole-stand CO2 regime achieved during enrichment. In the second summer season of operation of the FACE system, atmospheric CO2 enrichment was conducted in the forest during all daylight hours for 96.7\% of the scheduled running time from 23 May to 14 October with a preset target [CO2] of 550{~}$\mu$mol{~}mol--1, $\approx${~}200{~}$\mu$mol{~}mol--1 above ambient [CO2]. The system provided spatial and temporal control of [CO2] similar to that reported for open-top chambers over trees, but without enclosing the vegetation. The daily average daytime [CO2] within the upper forest canopy at the centre of the FACE plot was 552{~}$\pm${~}9{~}$\mu$mol mol--1 (mean $\pm${~}SD). The FACE system maintained 1-minute average [CO2] to within $\pm${~}110{~}$\mu$mol mol--1 of the target [CO2] for 92\% of the operating time. Deviations of [CO2] outside of this range were short-lived (most lasting {\textless}{~}60{~}s) and rare, with fewer than 4 excursion events of a{~}minute or longer per day. Acceptable spatial control of [CO2] by the system was achieved, with over 90\% of the entire canopy volume within $\pm${~}10\% of the target [CO2] over the exposure season. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was much higher than for open-top chambers on an absolute basis, but similar to that of open-top chambers and branch bag chambers on a per unit volume basis. CO2 consumption by the FACE system was strongly related to windspeed, averaging 50{~}g CO2 m--3 h--1 for the stand for an average windspeed of 1.5{~}m{~}s--1 during summer. The [CO2] control results show that the free-air approach is a tractable way to study long-term and short-term alterations in trace gases, even within entire tall forest ecosystems. The FACE approach permits the study of a wide range of forest stand and ecosystem processes under manipulated [CO2]a that were previously impossible or intractable to study in true forest ecosystems.},

P addition, but not N or OE, increased leaf area index within 12 months, foliar P concentration measured at 18 months, and stem diameter increment within 18 months. Stem growth at 18 months was even greater when trees fertilized with P also received the OE treatment. N and P additions increased leaf litterfall and N and P in combination further increased litterfall. The sequence of responses suggests that increased available P promoted an increase in photosynthetic area which led to increased wood production. P was the essential element most limiting to primary production on old volcanic soil in contrast to the N limitation found on young volcanic soils.},

  Abstract                 = {Vegetation phenology is the study of the timing of seasonal events that are considered to be the result of adaptive responses to climate variations on short and long time scales. In the field of remote sensing of vegetation phenology, phenological metrics are derived from time series of optical data. For that purpose, considerable effort has been specifically focused on developing noise reduction and cloud-contaminated data removal techniques to improve the quality of remotely-sensed time series. Comparative studies between time series composed of satellite data acquired under clear and cloudy conditions and from radiometric data obtained with high accuracy from ground-based measurements constitute a direct and effective way to assess the operational use and limitations of remote sensing for predicting the main plant phenological events. In the present paper, we sought to explicitly evaluate the potential use of MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data for monitoring the seasonal dynamics of different types of vegetation cover that are representative of the major terrestrial biomes, including temperate deciduous forests, evergreen forests, African savannah, and crops. After cloud screening and filtering, we compared the temporal patterns and phenological metrics derived from in situ NDVI time series and from MODIS daily and 16-composite products. We also evaluated the effects of residual noise and the influence of data gaps in MODIS NDVI time series on the identification of the most relevant metrics for vegetation phenology monitoring. The results show that the inflexion points of a model fitted to a MODIS NDVI time series allow accurate estimates of the onset of greenness in the spring and the onset of yellowing in the autumn in deciduous forests (RMSE {\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textcurrency} one week). Phenological metrics identical to those provided with the MODIS Global Vegetation Phenology product (MDC12Q2) are less robust to data gaps, and they can be subject to large biases of approximately two weeks or more during the autumn phenological transitions. In the evergreen forests, in situ NDVI time series describe the phenology with high fidelity despite small temporal changes in the canopy foliage. However, MODIS is unable to provide consistent phenological patterns. In crops and savannah, MODIS NDVI time series reproduce the general temporal patterns of phenology, but significant discrepancies appear between MODIS and ground-based NDVI time series during very localized periods of time depending on the weather conditions and spatial heterogeneity within the MODIS pixel. In the rainforest, the temporal pattern exhibited by a MODIS 16-day composite NDVI time series is more likely due to a pattern of noise in the NDVI data structure according to both rainy and dry seasons rather than to phenological changes. More investigations are needed, but in all cases, this result leads us to conclude that MODIS time series in tropical rainforests should be interpreted with great caution.},

  Abstract                 = {The process-based model FOREST-BGC calculates the flow of water, carbon and nitrogen through forest ecosystems. This model, originally developed for conifer species, has been adapted to a Mediterranean evergreen oak species: Quercus ilex. This application requires species specific parameters and modification of the model. First, we attempted to reproduce the level of drought stress experienced by the holm oak using a new relationship between soil water content and soil water potential. Second, to take into account the coppice structure of these ecosystems and the small stem diameter, we assumed that all the woody biomass was respiring. A 50-year simulation was performed for the homogeneous ecosystem at the Pu{\~{A}}{\copyright}chabon site, southern France. Water and carbon flows and biomass were examined for the last period, 1984{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}1993. Simulated values were compared with (1) measured soil water content and predawn leaf water potential from 1984 to 1986, (2) wood annual radial growth recorded since 1984, and (3) standing biomass estimated at the Pu{\~{A}}{\copyright}chabon site. The simulated predawn leaf water potential decreased in summer and reached {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}3.9 MPa in 1985. For the 1984{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}1993 period, mean ecosystem transpiration was 363 mm per year for a leaf area index of 2.9. The mean annual gross primary production was 1354 g C m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2 soil. Simulated mean annual carbon allocated to aboveground wood was 85 g C m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2 soil. In 1993, the simulated aboveground biomass of the ecosystem was 3275 g C m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2 soil for wood and 252 g C m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2 soil for leaves. These simulation results are in agreement with field measurements on the Pu{\~{A}}{\copyright}chabon site and on similar ecosystems in the Mediterranean region. They reproduced the intra-annual effects of the drought stress on holm oak. These results show that the FOREST-BGC model can be used for modeling the function and growth of Mediterranean oak coppice.},

  Abstract                 = {Land devoted to plantation forestry (50{~}million{~}ha) has been increasing worldwide and the genus Eucalyptus is a popular plantation species (14{~}million{~}ha) for its rapid growth and ability to grow well on a wide range of sites. Fertilization is a common silvicultural tool to improve tree growth with potential effects on stand water use, but the relationship between wood growth and water use in response to fertilization remains poorly quantified. Our objectives in this study were to determine the extent, timing and longevity of fertilization effects on water use and wood growth in a non-water limited Eucalyptus saligna experimental forest near Hilo, HI. We evaluated the short- and long-term effects of fertilization on water use by measuring sap flux per unit sapwood area, canopy conductance, transpiration per unit leaf area and water-use efficiency in control and fertilized stands. Short-term effects were assessed by comparing sap flux before and after fertilizer application. Long-term effects were assessed by comparing control plots and plots that had received nutrient additions for 5 years. For the short-term response, total water use in fertilized plots increased from 265 to 487{~}mm{~}yr$-$1 during the 5 months following fertilization. The increase was driven by an increase in stand leaf area accompanied by an increase in sap flux per unit sapwood area. Sap flux per unit leaf area and canopy conductance did not differ during the 5 months following fertilizer additions. For the last 2 months of our short-term measurements, fertilized trees used less water per unit carbon gain (361 compared with 751{~}kg{~}H2O{~}kg{~}C$-$1 in control stands). Trees with 5 years of fertilization also used significantly more water than controls (401 vs. 302{~}mm{~}yr$-$1) because of greater leaf area in the fertilized stands. Sap flux per unit sapwood area, sap flux per unit leaf area, and canopy conductance did not differ between control and fertilized trees in the long-term plots. In contrast to the short-term response, the long-term response of water use per unit wood growth was not significant. Overall, fertilization of E. saligna at our site increased stand water use by increasing leaf area. Fertilized trees grew more wood and used more water, but fertilization did not change wood growth per unit water use.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the key variables related to carbon, water and nutrient cycles in terrestrial ecosystems, but its global distribution patterns remain poorly understood. We evaluated the dependence of LAI on mean annual temperature (MAT) and wetness index (WI; a ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration) for three plant functional types (PFTs: deciduous broadleaf, DB; evergreen conifer, EC; evergreen broadleaf, EB) at the global scale. Location Global. Methods We developed a new global database of unprecedented size (2606 published values) of field-observed LAI (site-specific maximum) values for vegetation of woody species. To maximize the generic applicability of our analysis, we standardized the definition of LAI, and corrected or excluded potentially erroneous data obtained from indirect optical methods. Results The global dependence of LAI on MAT showed a reverse S-shaped pattern, in which LAI peaked at around 8.9 and 25.0{\^{A}}$\deg$C and was lowest at around {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}10.0 and 18.8{\^{A}}$\deg$C. The dependence on WI followed a saturation curve levelling off at around log WI = 0.30. LAI for evergreen forests increased linearly with increasing WI, but that for DB showed a curvilinear pattern saturating at log WI = 0.03. EC forests had higher LAI values than those of DB forests under cool conditions (MAT {\^{a}}{\textperthousand}{\textcurrency} 8.9{\^{A}}$\deg$C), but similar values under temperate conditions (MAT = 8.9{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}18.8{\^{A}}$\deg$C). Main conclusions This analysis of global LAI{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}climate relationships supports the general belief that temperature limits LAI under cool conditions whereas water availability plays a predominant role under other conditions. We also found that these patterns differed significantly between PFTs, suggesting that the LAI of different PFTs may respond differently to climate change. Our study provides a broad empirical basis for predicting the global distribution of LAI and for analysing the effects of global climate change on vegetation structure and function.},

  Abstract                 = {Aim Precipitation controls the production of semi-arid plants through various mechanisms that operate at a range of time-scales. Short-term variation in precipitation affects vegetation through adjustments in plant physiology and leaf phenology, whereas long-term effects are mediated by plant establishment and mortality, community composition and disturbance regimes. Our goal is to use remote sensing observations to separate the short- and long-term effects of variation in precipitation on ecosystem production. Location California, USA. Methods We used time series of gridded absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (APAR) to quantify the short- and long-term responses of diverse ecosystems to variation in precipitation across large productivity and precipitation gradients. We investigated the relationships between temporal sensitivity of APAR to interannual variation in precipitation and mean annual precipitation (MAP), ecosystem properties and disturbance. Results APAR increased with precipitation both interannually within locations and across locations with MAP. The slope of the interannual relationship, which reflects the sensitivity of APAR to short-term fluctuations in precipitation, varied with climate, vegetation type and structure, and time since disturbance.

The initial physiological and leaf area effects of a precipitation shift were amplified five-fold over time by gradual changes in population density and species composition. Main conclusion The impact of a hydroclimatic shift on the primary production, structure and function of California's terrestrial ecosystems depends heavily on time-scale and how rapidly changes in plant population density and community composition can occur.},

  Abstract                 = {Dehesa ecosystems of the southwestern Iberian Peninsula are characterized as a savanna-like rangeland dominated by scattered mediterranean evergreen oak trees. We investigated whether isolated trees modify the water balance of this ecosystem and if so, what implications this finding might have on models that assume homogeneity of soil water resources. The water balance of the two ecological components of the dehesas--(1) the tree-grass component, and (2) the open areas between the tree canopies with unshaded grass vegetation--was studied for three consecutive years in three locations in the Sierra Norte de Sevilla region of Andalusia in southern Spain. In this region, annual rainfall was generally between 600 and 800 mm, and the summer drought lasted @?130 d. Soil water storage was measured with a neutron moisture gauge outside and under the tree canopy. Deep drainage between two consecutive census dates was calculated using field-measured drainage characteristics. Evapotranspiration (Ea) and surface runoff were computed from the water balance equation assuming that Ea is limited by Penman potential evapotranspiration. Monthly Ea by annual species in open areas was poorly correlated with rainfall levels in the autumn and was limited during the spring by availability of water in the top 40 cm of soil. During summer, monthly Ea by trees ranged from 30 to 50 mm. Mean annual Ea was 400 mm outside and 590 mm under the tree cover. In open areas, water yield (WY), defined as the sum of deep drainage and surface runoff, ranged from 65 to 100\% of total Ea, whereas under the tree canopy WY was only 20 to 40\% of the Ea. Under the tree canopy, when annual precipitation was {\textless}570 mm, WY was negligible and all precipitation was lost by evapotranspiration. Outside the tree canopy, WY occurred as soon as annual precipitation exceed 250 mm. Models of competition between trees and grass generally assume a spatial homogeneity of soil hydrodynamic properties. Our results, however, show that both soil water storage and evapotranspiration are greater for the tree-grass component. Consequently, these models must account for this spatial variability in water resources according to species.},

The need for an objective, automatic, operator-independent thresholding method has long been of interest to scientists using hemispherical photography. This manuscript deals with the comparison of a wide variety of different well-known automatic thresholding techniques against the subjective manual method, using high-dynamic range digital hemispherical photographs. The performance of the different thresholding methods was evaluated based on: (1) visual inspection by means of a multi-criteria decision system and (2) quantitative analysis of the methods{\textquoteright} sensitivity to an overall performance criterium. The automatic Ridler clustering method proved to be the most robust thresholding method for various canopy structure conditions. This automatic method might be the best solution for a fast, reliable and objective use of hemispherical photographs for gap fraction and LAI estimation in forest stands, given that the threshold setting is no longer manually performed. The fine-tuning potential of local thresholding methods to better address particular photographic limitations (e.g. over-exposure in a certain image region) is also presented.},

The authors investigate the influence of differing, plausible LAI prescriptions on heat, moisture, and carbon fluxes simulated by the Community Atmosphere Biosphere Land Exchange version 1.4b (CABLEv1.4b) model over the Australian continent. A 15-member ensemble monthly LAI dataset is generated using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI product and gridded observations of temperature and precipitation. Offline simulations lasting 29 years (1980--2008) are carried out at 25-km resolution with the composite monthly means from the MODIS LAI product (control simulation) and compared with simulations using each of the 15-member ensemble monthly varying LAI datasets generated. The imposed changes in LAI did not strongly influence the sensible and latent fluxes, but the carbon fluxes were more strongly affected. Croplands showed the largest sensitivity in gross primary production with differences ranging from $-$90\% to 60\%. Plant function types (PFTs) with high absolute LAI and low interannual variability, such as evergreen broadleaf trees, showed the least response to the different LAI prescriptions, while those with lower absolute LAI and higher interannual variability, such as croplands, were more sensitive. The authors show that reliance on a single LAI prescription may not accurately reflect the uncertainty in the simulation of terrestrial carbon fluxes, especially for PFTs with high interannual variability. The study highlights that accurate representation of LAI in land surface models is key to the simulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence, this will become critical in quantifying the uncertainty in future changes in primary production.},

  Abstract                 = {[1] Current increase in atmospheric CO2 is expected to modify both climate and plant function, thereby impacting plant structure and gas exchange. We investigate the effects of doubled CO2 on leaf area index (LAI) and evapotranspiration (ETR) using a global vegetation model for present-day and doubled-CO2 conditions. The model assumes that adaptation of plants to the local climate leads to an equilibrium LAI, which depends on resource availability (minimizing water stress, canopy carbon cost and self-shading). The model compares reasonably well with remote sensing estimates of LAI. Four doubled-CO2 simulations are designed to investigate the role of climate, CO2-induced stomatal closure, enhanced photosynthesis, and a combination of these effects. These simulations show that plant physiological responses to doubled CO2 are potentially more important than climate changes for LAI, and equally important for ETR. In addition, even the sign of the simulated changes in LAI and ETR varies with the assumptions on plant responsiveness to CO2. A reduction of stomatal conductance moderates or cancels the water losses caused by a warmer and drier climate, but photosynthesis stimulation counteracts this stomatal effect, especially in the mid-to-high latitudes, because of enhanced LAI. Experimental evidence of LAI and ETR response to CO2 has been reviewed and compared to the different simulations. On the basis of this confrontation we argue that plant response to CO2 doubling may have a relatively small net impact on global ETR and may cause a moderate increase of LAI. Tree stomata may be less responsive to CO2 than was previously assumed, and stimulated plant growth partly cancels the water savings caused by stomatal closure. Understanding the responses of plant canopies to CO2 is therefore critical for land surface hydrology in a CO2 rich world.},

  Abstract                 = {Estimates of leaf area index obtained with indirect measurement techniques, which are replacing more arduous destructive sampling methods, are frequently questioned due to light interception by woody elements and a non-random distribution of foliage elements. Usually, branches are assumed to be positioned randomly with respect to leaves or shoots in the canopy. However, in this study of boreal forest architecture, branches are shown to be preferentially shaded by other non-woody elements (e.g. shoots or leaves) in both coniferous and deciduous species of the boreal region. A new instrument called a Multiband Vegetation Imager (MVI) is used to capture two-band (Visible, 400{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}620 nm and Near-Infrared, 720{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}950 nm) image pairs of contrasting Canadian boreal forest canopies during the BOReal Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study (BOREAS). The spatial relationship of branches and photosynthetically active foliage is studied to estimate the fraction of the effective branch hemi-surface area index (Be) that is masked by leaves and shoots. We suggest an approach that corrects indirect LAI measurements using the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument by correcting for the following biases: (1) the effective canopy branch hemi-surface area that is not masked by leaves or shoots in the canopy, (2) the amount of stem hemi-surface area beneath crowns, (3) leaf (or shoot) ({\^{I}}{\copyright}e({\^{I}}{\c{}})) and branch ({\^{I}}{\copyright}b({\^{I}}{\c{}})) non-random spatial distributions in the canopy, and (4) the fraction of maximum LAI resulting from defoliation in the canopy. In boreal aspen, MVI image analysis shows that 95\% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. In jack pine and black spruce forests, 80{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}90\% of the effective branch hemi-surface area is masked by other foliage in the canopy. These estimates suggest the fraction of indirect LAI that consists of branches intercepting light is less than 10\%. Therefore, branches generally do not intercept a significant amount of beam radiation in boreal forests, and do not significantly bias indirect LAI measurements. However, stems, which comprise 30{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}50\% of the total woody area in this study, may not be preferentially shaded by leafy foliage. Therefore, stem contribution to indirect LAI estimates measured with the LAI-2000 or a similar instrument cannot be overlooked. MVI estimates of the total branch hemi-surface area index agree to within 10{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}40\% of direct measurements made in similar species; however, the error between indirect and direct measurements may be due largely to difficulties associated with obtaining adequate sampling so that the error may fall within the noise level of measurements.},

The two populations from moist habitats wilted at a higher relative turgidity of leaves than did the populations from the drier habitats. Furthermore, for populations from one dry habitat and one moist habitat, changes in relative turgidity in relation to water potential of leaves during drying were not significantly different. It is suggested that the greater tolerance of the low rainfall populations to drought is related to physiological resistance of the protoplasm to desiccation.{\textless}P{\textgreater} Some differences in drought resistance were also noted between the two low rainfall populations. Young seedlings (3 months old) from a population on a deep basalt-derived soil were less resistant than young seedlings from a neighbouring population on a shallower granite soil.

  Abstract                 = {During three growing seasons, phenology and damage on leafy shoots of healthy eucalypts and others with dieback were monitored on pastoral properties in the Australian Capital Territory. Leaves from the dieback trees tended to be younger than those from nearby healthy trees. Leaves that were not lost prematurely lived for similar lengths of time on both dieback and healthy trees, but more leaves were initiated on the dieback trees. Dieback trees were also less active reproductively. During the study, chewing insects caused most of the damage on leaves, and there was usually more of this damage on leaves from the dieback trees. Young leaves accumulated damage at a much faster rate than older leaves, and this probably contributed to the relatively greater damage on the leaves from the dieback trees. However, the differences in the amount of damage on the leaves from healthy and dieback trees were not solely due to the differences in ages of the leaves. Generalized linear models which equalized the effects of the differences in leafing phenology produced adjusted estimates for damage to leaves that were still higher for dieback trees.},

We have compared maximum LAI, measured using the LI-COR LAI-2000 PCA, throughout 4 years and over 420 ha of a temperate forest across a range of stand structure (density, biomass, age) and site fertility (soil nutrient and water availability). LAI values ranged from 0.5 to 8 m2 m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2. This study has shown that maximal LAI was relatively stable between years. However, although the water stress did not affect LAI development in the current year, it reduced LAI of the following year only in stands with high LAI (above 5.5 m2 m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2). Spatial variations of maximal LAI were mainly dependent on forest management which affected tree density and stand diameter at breast height (DBH) through thinning and harvesting. Among the 34 deciduous stands studied, maximal LAI increased with tree density up to a value of about 1000 stems per ha and then it reached a plateau between 6 and 8 m2 m{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}2. Total leaf area per tree has a strong correlation to DBH for species with different sap conducting system (r2 = 0.94). Decreases of maximal LAI with humus quality were observed, suggesting that, although forest management appears to be the main cause of LAI variations between stands and between years, soil fertility may be a determinant of stand LAI.},

The FACE system using prediluted CO2 fumigation technology exhibited less temporal and spatial variability than the pure CO2 fumigation system. The pure CO2 fumigation system tended to over-fumigate the upwind portions of the plot and used 25\% more CO2 than the prediluted CO2 fumigation system. The increased CO2 use by the pure CO2 system was exacerbated at low wind speeds. It is not clear if this phenomenon will also be observed in plots with smaller diameters and low-stature vegetation.},

This is particularly important for Mediterranean forests, where precipitation is expected to decrease as a consequence of climate change. Impacts of increased drought on the photosynthetic capacity of the evergreen Quercus ilex were studied for two years in a mature forest submitted to long-term throughfall exclusion. Gas exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence were measured on two successive leaf cohorts in a control and a dry plot. Exclusion significantly reduced leaf water potential in the dry treatment. In both treatments, light-saturated net assimilation rate (Amax), stomatal conductance (gs), maximum carboxylation rate (Vcmax), maximum rate of electron transport (Jmax), mesophyll conductance to CO2 (gm) and nitrogen investment in photosynthesis decreased markedly with soil water limitation during summer. The relationships between leaf photosynthetic parameters and leaf water potential remained identical in the two treatments. Leaf and canopy acclimation to progressive, long-term drought occurred through changes in leaf area index, leaf mass per area and leaf chemical composition, but not through modifications of physiological parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {The phenology of a landscape is a key parameter in climate and biogeochemical cycle models and its correct representation is central to the accurate simulation of carbon, water and energy exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. Whereas biogeographic phenological patterns and shifts have received much attention in temperate ecosystems, much less is known about the phenology of savannas, despite their sensitivity to climate change and their coverage of approximately one eighth of the global land surface. Savannas are complex assemblages of multiple tree, shrub, and grass vegetation strata, each with variable phenological responses to seasonal climate and environmental variables. The objectives of this study were to investigate biogeographical and inter-annual patterns in savanna phenology along a 1100 km ecological rainfall gradient, known as North Australian Tropical Transect (NATT), encompassing humid coastal Eucalyptus forests and woodlands to xeric inland Acacia woodlands and shrublands. Key phenology transition dates (start, peak, end, and length of seasonal greening periods) were extracted from 13 years (2000{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}2012) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) data using Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).
Two distinct biogeographical patterns in phenology were observed, controlled by different climate systems. The northern (mesic) portion of the transect, from 12{\^{A}}$\deg$S, to around 17.7{\^{A}}$\deg$S, was influenced by the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) seasonal monsoon climate system, resulting in strong latitudinal shifts in phenology patterns, primarily associated with the functional response of the C4 grass layer. Both the start and end of the greening (enhanced vegetation activity) season occurred earlier in the northern tropical savannas and were progressively delayed towards the southern limit of the Eucalyptus-dominated savannas resulting in relatively stable length of greening periods. In contrast, the southern xeric portion of the study area was largely decoupled from monsoonal influences and exhibited highly variable phenology that was largely rainfall pulse driven. The seasonal greening periods were generally shorter but fluctuated widely from no detectable greening during extended drought periods to length of greening seasons that exceeded those in the more mesic northern savannas in some wet years. This was in part due to more extreme rainfall variability, as well as a C3/C4 grass-forb understory that provided the potential for extended greening periods. Phenology of Acacia dominated savannas displayed a much greater overall responsiveness to hydroclimatic variability. The variance in annual precipitation alone could explain 80\% of the variances in the length of greening season across the major vegetation groups. We also found that increased variation in the timing of phenology was coupled with a decreasing tree-grass ratio. We further compared the satellite-based phenology results with tower-derived measures of Gross Ecosystem Production (GEP) fluxes at three sites over two contrasting savanna classes. We found good convergence between MODIS EVI and tower GEP, thereby confirming the potential to link these two independent data sources to better understand savanna ecosystem functioning.},

  Abstract                 = {The leaf area index (LAI) of fast-growing Eucalyptus plantations is highly dynamic both seasonally and inter-annually, and is spatially variable depending on pedo-climatic conditions. LAI is very important in determining the carbon and water balance of a stand, but is difficult to measure during a complete stand rotation and at large scales. Remote-sensing methods allowing the retrieval of LAI time series with accuracy and precision are therefore necessary. Here, we tested two methods for LAI estimation from MODIS 250m resolution red and near-infrared (NIR) reflectance time series. The first method involved the inversion of a coupled model of leaf reflectance and transmittance (PROSPECT4), soil reflectance (SOILSPECT) and canopy radiative transfer (4SAIL2). Model parameters other than the LAI were either fixed to measured constant values, or allowed to vary seasonally and/or with stand age according to trends observed in field measurements. The LAI was assumed to vary throughout the rotation following a series of alternately increasing and decreasing sigmoid curves. The parameters of each sigmoid curve that allowed the best fit of simulated canopy reflectance to MODIS red and NIR reflectance data were obtained by minimization techniques. The second method was based on a linear relationship between the LAI and values of the GEneralized Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (GESAVI), which was calibrated using destructive LAI measurements made at two seasons, on Eucalyptus stands of different ages and productivity levels. The ability of each approach to reproduce field-measured LAI values was assessed, and uncertainty on results and parameter sensitivities were examined. Both methods offered a good fit between measured and estimated LAI (R2 = 0.80 and R2 = 0.62 for model inversion and GESAVI-based methods, respectively), but the GESAVI-based method overestimated the LAI at young ages.},

  Abstract                 = {Like many midlatitude ecosystems, Mediterranean forests will suffer longer and more intense droughts with the ongoing climate change. The responses to drought in long-lived trees differ depending on the time scale considered, and short-term responses are currently better understood than longer term acclimation. We assessed the temporal changes in trees facing a chronic reduction in water availability by comparing leaf-scale physiological traits, branch-scale hydraulic traits, and stand-scale biomass partitioning in the evergreen Quercus ilex across a regional precipitation gradient (long-term changes) and in a partial throughfall exclusion experiment (TEE, medium term changes). At the leaf scale, gas exchange, mass per unit area and nitrogen concentration showed homeostatic responses to drought as they did not change among the sites of the precipitation gradient or in the experimental treatments of the TEE. A similar homeostatic response was observed for the xylem vulnerability to cavitation at the branch scale. In contrast, the ratio of leaf area over sapwood area (LA/SA) in young branches exhibited a transient response to drought because it decreased in response to the TEE the first 4 years of treatment, but did not change among the sites of the gradient. At the stand scale, leaf area index (LAI) decreased, and the ratios of stem SA to LAI and of fine root area to LAI both increased in trees subjected to throughfall exclusion and from the wettest to the driest site of the gradient. Taken together, these results suggest that acclimation to chronic drought in long-lived Q. ilex is mediated by changes in hydraulic allometry that shift progressively from low (branch) to high (stand) organizational levels, and act to maintain the leaf water potential within the range of xylem hydraulic function and leaf photosynthetic assimilation.},

  Abstract                 = {The continuous and automated monitoring of canopy phenology is of increasing scientific interest for the multiple implications of vegetation dynamics on ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes. For this purpose we evaluated the applicability of digital camera imagery for monitoring and modeling phenology and physiology of a subalpine grassland over the 2009 and 2010 growing seasons.
We tested the relationships between color indices (i.e. the algebraic combinations of RGB brightness levels) tracking canopy greenness extracted from repeated digital images against field measurements of green and total biomass, leaf area index (LAI), greenness visual estimation, vegetation indices computed from continuous spectroradiometric measurements and CO2 fluxes observed with the eddy covariance technique. A strong relationship was found between canopy greenness and (i) structural parameters (i.e., LAI) and (ii) canopy photosynthesis (i.e. Gross Primary Production; GPP). Color indices were also well correlated with vegetation indices typically used for monitoring landscape phenology from satellite, suggesting that digital repeat photography provides high-quality ground data for evaluation of satellite phenology products.
We demonstrate that by using canopy greenness we can refine phenological models (Growing Season Index, GSI) by describing canopy development and considering the role of ecological factors (e.g., snow, temperature and photoperiod) controlling grassland phenology. Moreover, we show that canopy greenness combined with radiation use efficiency (RUE) obtained from spectral indices related to photochemistry (i.e., scaled Photochemical Reflectance Index) or meteorology (i.e., MOD17 RUE) can be used to predict daily GPP.
Building on previous work that has demonstrated that seasonal variation in the structure and function of plant canopies can be quantified using digital camera imagery, we have highlighted the potential use of these data for the development and parameterization of phenological and RUE models, and thus point toward an extension of the proposed methodologies to the dataset collected within PhenoCam Network.},

  Abstract                 = {Mediterranean regions are projected to experience more frequent, prolonged and severe drought as a consequence of climate change. We used a retractable rainfall shelter, to investigate the impact of extreme droughts on the development of Quercus ilex leaves, flowers and fruit. In 2008, 97\% of rainfall was excluded from a forest plot during the autumn, representing 50\% of the 1127 mm of rain that fell during the year. In 2009, 87\% of rainfall was excluded during the spring, representing 58\% of the 749 mm that fell during the year. The rainfall shelter did not impact neither incident radiation nor air temperature. Autumn rainfall exclusion did not significantly affect leaf, flowers or fruit development. Spring rainfall exclusion resulted in larger and more sustained depression of leaf water potential during the key phases of foliar and floral development. Consequently, only half of the sampled trees (6) reached the shoot lengthening stage which leads to functionally mature leaves (phenophase 4), with one abandoning leaf development at budburst (phenophase 3) and the other two at the bud swelling stage (phenophase 2). All trees of the control plot passed phenophase 4, with most reaching complete leaf development. The impact of extreme droughts on flower development differed between the sexes. The spring exclusion had no effect on male flower, but only one of six trees completed female fruit maturation, compared with four in the control plot. The difference between the male and female drought impacts is likely attributable to the occurrence of male floral development before the period of lowest leaf water potential, and to the lower resource allocation requirements of male flowers. The information provided by our experimental approach may constitute a crucial step to evaluate the impact of increasing drought due to climate change on the most dominant Mediterranean tree species and to help drawing a full picture of the ecological consequences of the decline in water resource on forest dynamics under changing conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {In plants, carbon (C) molecules provide building blocks for biomass production, fuel for energy, and exert signalling roles to shape development and metabolism. Accordingly, plant growth is well correlated with light interception and energy conversion through photosynthesis. Because water deficits close stomata and thus reduce C entry, it has been hypothesised that droughted plants are under C starvation and their growth under C limitation. In this review, these points are questioned by combining literature review with experimental and modelling illustrations in various plant organs and species. First, converging evidence is gathered from the literature that water deficit generally increases C concentration in plant organs. The hypothesis is raised that this could be due to organ expansion (as a major C sink) being affected earlier and more intensively than photosynthesis (C source) and metabolism. How such an increase is likely to interact with C signalling is not known. Hence, the literature is reviewed for possible links between C and stress signalling that could take part in this interaction. Finally, the possible impact of water deficit-induced C accumulation on growth is questioned for various sink organs of several species by combining published as well as new experimental data or data generated using a modelling approach. To this aim, robust correlations between C availability and sink organ growth are reported in the absence of water deficit. Under water deficit, relationships weaken or are modified suggesting release of the influence of C availability on sink organ growth. These results are interpreted as the signature of a transition from source to sink growth limitation under water deficit.},

  Abstract                 = {We hypothesize that a necessary equilibrium exists between climate, soil water-holding capacity and maximum leaf area in water limited coniferous forest ecosystems. To test this hypothesis over a large range of forests in Montana, spectral reflectance data from two different satellite sensors, Landsat/Thematic Mapper and NOAA/AVHRR, were combined with leaf area index (LAI) measured or simulated from a forest ecosystem model, FOREST-BGC. Transpiration simulated by the model with representative climatic and soil data was used to calculate equilibrium leaf area index of 20 mature conifer forest stands across Montana. A strong correlation was found between calculated and field measured of leaf area index, R2 = 0.87. To test if satellite data can estimate LAI, measured leaf area index was correlated with spectral reflectance data from TM computed as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for 17 stands (R2 = 0.58). Then, LAI for 53 conifer stands across Montana was estimated using our equilibrium concept and related to AVHRR/NDVI at 1.1 km scale (R2 = 0.88). Species composition was found to be important only at the TM pixel scale of 30 m. AVHRR/NDVI provided an initial validation of our hydrologic equilibrium theory at regional scales. A quantitative relationship between climate defined simply as precipitation/potential evaporation, soil water-holding capacity and leaf area was developed using the model simulations. This relationship allows the prediction of either equilibrium leaf area index or soil water-holding capacity if the other is known.},

  Abstract                 = {Plants in Mediterranean ecosystems face multiple environmental stresses during the growing season. Such stresses greatly affect ecosystem function, but are poorly represented by current ecosystem models. Here, we review recent advances in understanding the responses of ecosystem photosynthesis to drought and photoinhibition. Reductions in canopy net assimilation rates by recurrent water limitations during the day and during drought periods result from multiple limitations at the biochemical, cellular and structural levels, including reductions in stomatal, and mesophyll diffusion conductances, foliage biochemical potentials, light harvesting efficiency and modifications in canopy structure. Overall, a hierarchy of environmental effects, from instantaneous, short- and long-term influences, shape photosynthetic responses to stress in the field. The processes involved can be incorporated into photosynthesis models to different degrees, given our current understanding of each. However, fully mechanistic consideration of certain phenomena such as non-reversible, hysteretic and lagged heat and drought effects, or photoinhibition, would require the use of models including dynamic damage and repair mechanisms. We outline further model and experimental work needed to describe the parameter space for quantitative simulation of such phenomena, especially considering the need to simulate plant production under global change.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change predictions derived from coupled carbon-climate models are highly dependent on assumptions about feedbacks between the biosphere and atmosphere. One critical feedback occurs if C uptake by the biosphere increases in response to the fossil-fuel driven increase in atmospheric [CO2] ({\textquotedblleft}CO2 fertilization{\textquotedblright}), thereby slowing the rate of increase in atmospheric [CO2]. Carbon exchanges between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere are often first represented in models as net primary productivity (NPP). However, the contribution of CO2 fertilization to the future global C cycle has been uncertain, especially in forest ecosystems that dominate global NPP, and models that include a feedback between terrestrial biosphere metabolism and atmospheric [CO2] are poorly constrained by experimental evidence. We analyzed the response of NPP to elevated CO2 ($\approx$550 ppm) in four free-air CO2 enrichment experiments in forest stands. We show that the response of forest NPP to elevated [CO2] is highly conserved across a broad range of productivity, with a stimulation at the median of 23 $\pm$ 2\%. At low leaf area indices, a large portion of the response was attributable to increased light absorption, but as leaf area indices increased, the response to elevated [CO2] was wholly caused by increased light-use efficiency. The surprising consistency of response across diverse sites provides a benchmark to evaluate predictions of ecosystem and global models and allows us now to focus on unresolved questions about carbon partitioning and retention, and spatial variation in NPP response caused by availability of other growth limiting resources.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf area index (LAI) and its seasonal dynamics are key determinants of terrestrial productivity and, therefore, of the response of ecosystems to a rising atmospheric CO2 concentration. Despite the central importance of LAI, there is very little evidence from which to assess how forest LAI will respond to increasing [CO2]. We assessed LAI and related leaf indices of a closed-canopy deciduous forest for 4 years in 25-m-diameter plots that were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 (542 ppm) in a free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiment. LAI of this Liquidambar styraciflua (sweetgum) stand was about 6 and was relatively constant year-to-year, including the 2 years prior to the onset of CO2 treatment. LAI throughout the 1999-2002 growing seasons was assessed through a combination of data on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) transmittance, mass of litter collected in traps, and leaf mass per unit area (LMA). There was no effect of [CO2] on any expression of leaf area, including peak LAI, average LAI, or leaf area duration. Canopy mass and LMA, however, were significantly increased by CO2 enrichment. The hypothesized connection between light compensation point (LCP) and LAI was rejected because LCP was reduced by [CO2] enrichment only in leaves under full sun, but not in shaded leaves. Data on PAR interception also permitted calculation of absorbed PAR (APAR) and light use efficiency (LUE), which are key parameters connecting satellite assessments of terrestrial productivity with ecosystem models of future productivity. There was no effect of [CO2] on APAR, and the observed increase in net primary productivity in elevated [CO2] was ascribed to an increase in LUE, which ranged from 1.4 to 2.4 g MJ(-1). The current evidence seems convincing that LAI of non-expanding forest stands will not be different in a future CO2-enriched atmosphere and that increases in LUE and productivity in elevated [CO2] are driven primarily by functional responses rather than by structural changes. Ecosystem or regional models that incorporate feedbacks on resource use through LAI should not assume that LAI will increase with CO2 enrichment of the atmosphere.},

  Abstract                 = {The need to assess the role of forests in the global cycling of carbon and how that role will change as the atmospheric concentration of CO2 increases has spawned many experiments over a range of scales. Experiments using open-top chambers have been established at many sites to test whether the short-term responses of tree seedlings described in controlled environments would be sustained over several growing seasons under field conditions. Here we review the results of those experiments, using the framework of the interacting cycles of carbon, water and nutrients, because that is the framework of the ecosystem models that are being used to address the decades-long response of forests. Our analysis suggests that most of what was learned in seedling studies was qualitatively correct. The evidence from field-grown trees suggests a continued and consistent stimulation of photosynthesis of about 60\% for a 300 p.p.m. increase in [CO2], and there is little evidence of the long-term loss of sensitivity to CO2 that was suggested by earlier experiments with tree seedlings in pots. Despite the importance of respiration to a tree's carbon budget, no strong scientific consensus has yet emerged concerning the potential direct or acclimation response of woody plant respiration to CO2 enrichment. The relative effect of CO2 on above-ground dry mass was highly variable and greater than that indicated by most syntheses of seedling studies. Effects of CO2 concentration on static measures of response are confounded with the acceleration of ontogeny observed in elevated CO2. The trees in these open-top chamber experiments were in an exponential growth phase, and the large growth responses to elevated CO2 resulted from the compound interest associated with an increasing leaf area. This effect cannot be expected to persist in a closed-canopy forest where growth potential is constrained by a steady-state leaf area index. A more robust and informative measure of tree growth in these experiments is the annual increment in wood mass per unit leaf area, which increased 27\% in elevated CO2. There is no support for the conclusion from many studies of seedlings that root-to-shoot ratio is increased by elevated CO2; the production of fine roots may be enhanced, but it is not clear that this response would persist in a forest. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were lower in CO2-enriched trees, but to a lesser extent than was indicated in seedling studies and only when expressed on a leaf mass basis. The prediction that leaf litter C/N ratio would increase was not supported in field experiments. Also contrasting with seedling studies, there is little evidence from the field studies that stomatal conductance is consistently affected by CO2; however, this is a topic that demands more study. Experiments with trees in open-top chambers under field conditions have provided data on longer-term, larger-scale responses of trees to elevated CO2 under field conditions, confirmed some of the conclusions from previous seedling studies, and challenged other conclusions. There remain important obstacles to using these experimental results to predict forest responses to rising CO2, but the studies are valuable nonetheless for guiding ecosystem model development and revealing the critical questions that must be addressed in new, larger-scale CO2 experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {Potted cuttings of three Eucalyptus globulus Labill. clones (AR3, CN44, MP11) were either well watered or subjected to one of two soil water deficit regimes for six months in a greenhouse. Reductions in lateral branching, leaf production and leaf expansion were the leading contributors to the large differences observed in biomass production between well-watered and water-stressed plants. Although no significant differences among clones were observed in dry matter accumulation or in the magnitude of the response to soil water deficits, sensitivity of lateral branching, leaf initiation and whole-plant foliage to water stress was significantly lower in CN44 than in AR3 and MP11. When the confounding effect of differences in plant size resulting from the different watering regimes was removed, allometric analysis indicated that the genotypes differed in biomass allocation patterns. In addition to a drought-induced reduction in leaf number, water deficits also resulted in smaller leaves because leaf expansion was inhibited during dehydration events. Resumption of leaf expansion following stress relief occurred in all of the clones, but was particularly evident in severely stressed plants of Clone AR3, possibly as a result of the osmotic adjustment observed in this genotype.},

Studies of time-series of leaf-unfolding, flowering and fruiting over the last 50 yr in central Catalonia were carried out, and greenup onset in the Iberian Peninsula was monitored by satellite images. * {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textcent} Experimental, historical and geographical changes in rainfall produced significant, complex and strongly species-specific, as well as spatially and temporally variable, phenological effects. Among these changes, it was found that in the Iberian Peninsula, greenup onset changes from spring (triggered by rising temperatures) in the northern cool-wet regions to autumn (triggered by the arrival of autumn rainfalls) in the southern warm-dry regions. Even in the mesic Mediterranean central Catalonia (NE of the peninsula) rainfall had a stronger relative influence than temperature on fruiting phenology. * {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textcent} The results show that changes in rainfall and water availability, an important driver of climate change, can cause complex phenological changes with likely far-reaching consequences for ecosystem and biosphere functioning and structure. The seasonal shift in the Iberian Peninsula further highlights this importance and indicates that vegetation may respond to climate change not only with gradual, but also with abrupt temporal and spatial, changes in the timing of greenup onset.},

The ability to predict ecological responses has often been hampered by our rather limited understanding of trophic interactions. Indeed, it has proven difficult to discern direct and indirect effects of environmental change on animal populations owing to limited information about vegetation at large temporal and spatial scales. The rapidly increasing use of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) in ecological studies has recently changed this situation. Here, we review the use of the NDVI in recent ecological studies and outline its possible key role in future research of environmental change in an ecosystem context.},

  Abstract                 = {Climate change is predicted to increase both drought frequency and duration, and when coupled with substantial warming, will establish a new hydroclimatological model for many regions. Large-scale, warm droughts have recently occurred in North America, Africa, Europe, Amazonia and Australia, resulting in major effects on terrestrial ecosystems, carbon balance and food security. Here we compare the functional response of above-ground net primary production to contrasting hydroclimatic periods in the late twentieth century (1975{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}1998), and drier, warmer conditions in the early twenty-first century (2000{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}2009) in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. We find a common ecosystem water-use efficiency (WUEe: above-ground net primary production/evapotranspiration) across biomes ranging from grassland to forest that indicates an intrinsic system sensitivity to water availability across rainfall regimes, regardless of hydroclimatic conditions. We found higher WUEe in drier years that increased significantly with drought to a maximum WUEe across all biomes; and a minimum native state in wetter years that was common across hydroclimatic periods. This indicates biome-scale resilience to the interannual variability associated with the early twenty-first century drought{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}that is, the capacity to tolerate low, annual precipitation and to respond to subsequent periods of favourable water balance. These findings provide a conceptual model of ecosystem properties at the decadal scale applicable to the widespread altered hydroclimatic conditions that are predicted for later this century. Understanding the hydroclimatic threshold that will break down ecosystem resilience and alter maximum WUEe may allow us to predict land-surface consequences as large regions become more arid, starting with water-limited, low-productivity grasslands.},

Average canopy leaf area density over a sample plot of 36 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ was 0.23 m$^{\textrm{2}}$ m$^{\textrm{-3}}$ at a leaf area index of 4.3. Some 75\% of leaf area was held in the canopies of overstorey eucalypts above 10 m in height. Average size of leaves increased gradually from top to bottom of tree canopies.{\textless}P{\textgreater} Foliage production was usually concentrated in the upper crowns of trees where there was a higher proportion of active shoots, more frequent growth flushes and more rapid turnover of leaves than in lower canopy layers.

Pressure potentials increased with annual precipitation. Stem elongation, leaf size and leaf density were related more to stand age and transpiration per unit leaf-area index than to annual precipitation per se. The boundaries of the chaparral occur where transpiration is ca. 200 mm/year per unit leaf-area index, which .occurs with an annual precipitation of about 400 mm/year. With increasing precipitation, the leaf-area index can increase such that transpiration per unit leaf-area index remains at ca. 200 mm/year.},

  Abstract                 = {* Considerable uncertainty surrounds the fate of Amazon rainforests in response to climate change.


* Here, carbon (C) flux predictions of five terrestrial biosphere models (Community Land Model version 3.5 (CLM3.5), Ecosystem Demography model version 2.1 (ED2), Integrated BIosphere Simulator version 2.6.4 (IBIS), Joint UK Land Environment Simulator version 2.1 (JULES) and Simple Biosphere model version 3 (SiB3)) and a hydrodynamic terrestrial ecosystem model (the Soil--Plant--Atmosphere (SPA) model) were evaluated against measurements from two large-scale Amazon drought experiments.


* Model predictions agreed with the observed C fluxes in the control plots of both experiments, but poorly replicated the responses to the drought treatments. Most notably, with the exception of ED2, the models predicted negligible reductions in aboveground biomass in response to the drought treatments, which was in contrast to an observed c. 20\% reduction at both sites. For ED2, the timing of the decline in aboveground biomass was accurate, but the magnitude was too high for one site and too low for the other.


* Three key findings indicate critical areas for future research and model development. First, the models predicted declines in autotrophic respiration under prolonged drought in contrast to measured increases at one of the sites. Secondly, models lacking a phenological response to drought{~}introduced bias in the sensitivity of canopy productivity and respiration to drought. Thirdly, the phenomenological water-stress functions used by the terrestrial biosphere models to represent the effects of soil moisture on stomatal conductance yielded unrealistic diurnal and seasonal responses to drought.},

Australia which were subjected to markedly varying degrees of water and N stress.
Annual needle loss (death of green needles) was estimated as annual needle fall plus the increment (or minus the decrement) in the mass of dead needles held in the crown between successive winter measurements. Monthly estimates of needle production and loss were used to calculate seasonal (3-month) changes in total live foliage mass between annual winter measurements of foliage biomass.
Annual needle fall ranged from about 1.5 to 5.0 t ha{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1, and although well correlated with needle loss, the two parameters differed by up to 2 t ha{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1 as stands approached canopy closure. In stands closing canopy. 2{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}3 t ha{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1 of dead needles were retained in the crown. Loss in mass of needles due to leaching and decomposition during the period between senescence and fall results in needle fall being an underestimate of the mass of needles senescing in any year.
Annual needle loss was positively linearly correlated with total foliage biomass (r2 = 0.70) or stand basal area (r2=0.75) measured in the previous winter. The average life of needles declined from about 4 years in open stands not suffering severe water stress, to about 2 years after canopy closure or where water stress induced significant loss of foliage.
Monthly needle fall varied from less than 100 to greater than 500 kg ha{\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright}1 and was positively linearly correlated with a measure of cumulative tree water stress (the water stress integral, S{\"{I}}{\textasciicircum}) during the same month. The correlation was highest (r2=0.68) for fertilised stands which were most water stressed, and declined with declining water stress, S{\"{I}}{\textasciicircum} useful as a guide to the timing of needle fall, but not as a predictor of total annual needle fall which was mainly determined by foliage biomass of the stand. Older (mostly more than 2 years old) needles were shed largely in response to water stress, and in most years needle fall peaked in the summer-autumn period. In wet years and in irrigated stands the peak in needle fall was delayed by 3{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}6 months.},

Herein, presenting data for 128 cold temperate and boreal forests across a regional gradient of 600 km and 5.4°C (from 2.4°C to 7.8°C) in mean annual temperature, I show that stand-scale productivity is a function of the capacity to harvest light (represented by leaf area index, LAI), and to biochemically fix carbon (represented by canopy nitrogen concentration, \%N). In combination, LAI and canopy \%N explain greater than 75 per cent of variation in above-ground net primary productivity among forests, expressed per year or per day of growing season. After accounting for growing season length and climate effects, less than 10 per cent of the variance remained unexplained. These results mirror similar relations of leaf-scale and canopy-scale (eddy covariance) maximum photosynthetic rates to LAI and \%N. Collectively, these findings indicate that canopy structure and chemistry translate from instantaneous physiology to annual carbon fluxes. Given the increasing capacity to remotely sense canopy LAI, \%N and phenology, these results support the idea that physiologically based scaling relations can be useful tools for global modelling.},

Here we build on previous work and show how inexpensive, networked digital cameras ({\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}webcams{\^{a}}{\texteuro}�) can be used to document spatial and temporal variation in the spring and autumn phenology of forest canopies. We use two years of imagery from a deciduous, northern hardwood site, and one year of imagery from a coniferous, boreal transition site. A quantitative signal is obtained by splitting images into separate red, green, and blue color channels and calculating the relative brightness of each channel for {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}regions of interest{\^{a}}{\texteuro}� within each image. We put the observed phenological signal in context by relating it to seasonal patterns of gross primary productivity, inferred from eddy covariance measurements of surface{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}atmosphere CO2 exchange. We show that spring increases, and autumn decreases, in canopy greenness can be detected in both deciduous and coniferous stands. In deciduous stands, an autumn red peak is also observed. The timing and rate of spring development and autumn senescence varies across the canopy, with greater variability in autumn than spring. Interannual variation in phenology can be detected both visually and quantitatively; delayed spring onset in 2007 compared to 2006 is related to a prolonged cold spell from day 85 to day 110. This work lays the foundation for regional- to continental-scale camera-based monitoring of phenology at network observatory sites, e.g., National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) or AmeriFlux.},

  Abstract                 = {Leaf area index (LAI) is an important variable for understanding land-surface atmosphere flux dynamics and a key biophysical variable included in terrestrial biosphere models. Because of its influence on resource cycling and atmospheric feedbacks it is necessary to have a model that can accurately predict the seasonal progression of canopy development. The goal of this study is to use a simple function to modify a prognostic phenology model, based on the influence of environmental factors on limiting foliar phenology, into a model capable of predicting the seasonal course of LAI. Model performance was assessed by comparison to a time-series of LAI measurements derived from gap fraction theory at five deciduous sites selected from the FLUXNET database. The model was assessed in terms of its ability to predict the magnitude of LAI as well as phenological transition dates. The results show a strong correlation between predicted LAI and gap fraction derived estimates (r = 0.94, RMSE = 0.45). The accuracy of the model varied among sites at predicting transition dates but remained consistently high at predicting the continuous seasonal progression of LAI. Our results demonstrate that a simple prognostic phenology model can be rescaled to predict the seasonal course of LAI in deciduous forests.},

  Abstract                 = {Canopy phenology plays a prominent role in determining the timing and magnitude of carbon uptake by many ecosystems. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Global Land Cover Dynamics product developed from the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) provides broad spatial and temporal coverage of land-surface phenology (LSP), and may serve as a useful proxy for the phenology of canopy photosynthesis. Here, we compare the MODIS growing season start and end dates (SOS and EOS) with the seasonal phenology of canopy photosynthesis estimated using the eddy covariance approach. Using 153 site-years obtained from the Ameriflux database, we calculated the SOS and EOS of gross primary production (GPP) and canopy photosynthesis capacity (CPC) for seven different boreal and temperate vegetation types. CPC is GPP at maximum radiation, estimated by fitting half-hourly GPP and radiation to a rectangular hyperbolic function. We found large mean absolute differences of up to 53 days, depending on vegetation type, between the phenology of canopy development and photosynthesis, indicating that remotely sensed LSP is not a robust surrogate of seasonal changes in GPP, particularly for evergreen needleleaf forests. This limited correspondence of ecosystem carbon uptake with the MODIS LSP product points to the need for improved remotely sensed proxies of GPP phenology.},

  Abstract                 = {Regional climate models (RCMs) primarily represent physical components of the climate system, omitting vegetation dynamics, ecosystem biogeochemistry and their associated feedbacks. To account for such feedbacks, we implemented a novel plant individual-based vegetation dynamics-ecosystem biogeochemistry scheme within the RCA3 RCM. Variations in leaf area index (LAI) of seven plant functional type (PFTs) in response to physical forcing and evolving vegetation state feed back to climate via adjustments in surface energy fluxes and surface properties. In an ERA-40-driven simulation over Europe, the model reproduces the recent past climate with comparable accuracy to the standard RCM. Large-scale patterns of LAI, net primary production and vegetation composition were comparable with observations, although winter LAI was systematically overestimated compared to satellite estimates. Analysis of the ERA-40 simulation and an A1B climate-change simulation revealed considerable covariation among dynamic variables of the physical climate and vegetation. At a Mediterranean site, periodic soil water limitation led to fluctuations in leaf cover and a likely positive feedback to near-surface temperature. At an alpine site, rising temperatures led to forest advance onto tundra areas, reducing albedo and effecting a likely positive feedback on temperature. Climate{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}vegetation coupling was less pronounced but still apparent at intermediate temperate and boreal sites.},

  Abstract                 = {Plant phenology characterises the seasonal cyclicity of biological events such as budburst, flowering, fructification, leaf senescence and leaf fall. These biological events are genetically pre-determined but also strongly modulated by climatic conditions, particularly temperature, daylength and water availability. Therefore, the timing of these events is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts and as a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}climate interactions. In situ observations, empirical or bioclimatic models and remotely sensed time-series data constitute the three possible ways for monitoring the timing of plant phenological events. Remote sensing has the advantage of being the only way of surface sampling at high temporal frequency and, in the case of satellite-based remote sensing, over large regions. Nevertheless, exogenous factors, particularly atmospheric conditions, lead to some uncertainties on the seasonal course of surface reflectance and cause bias in the identification of vegetation phenological events. Since 2005, a network of forest and herbaceous sites has been equipped with laboratory made NDVI sensors to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy structure and phenology at an intra-daily time step. In this study, we present recent results obtained in several contrasting biomes in France, French Guiana, Belgium and Congo. These sites represent a gradient of vegetation ecosystems: the main evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in temperate climate region, an evergreen tropical rain forest in French Guiana, an herbaceous savanna ecosystem in Congo, and a succession of three annual crops in Belgium. In this paper, (1) we provide an accurate description of the seasonal dynamics of vegetation cover in these different ecosystems (2) we identify the most relevant remotely sensed markers from NDVI time-series for determining the dates of the main phenological events that characterize these ecosystems and (3) we discuss the relationships between temporal canopy dynamics and climate factors. In addition to its importance for phenological studies, this ground-based Network of NDVI measurement provides data needed for the calibration and direct validation of satellite observations and products.},

  Abstract                 = {Increasing the accuracy and spatial coverage of Leaf Area Index (LAI) values is an important part of any attempt to successfully model global atmosphere/biosphere interactions. It is further a fundamental parameter in land surface processes and Earth system climate models. Remote sensing methods offer an opportunity to improve on each of these requirements but are typically limited by the necessity for validation using labor intensive and sparsely collected in situ measurements.
In this paper we present the results of an intercomparative study of ground-based, airborne and spaceborne retrievals of total LAI over the conifer-dominated forests of Sierra Nevada in California. The efficacy of LVIS (Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor) airborne waveform lidar LAI measurements (total and vertical profile) has previously been validated at the site specific level using destructive sampling. We also explore the efficacy of ground based measurements obtained from hemispherical photography, LAI-2000, and ground based lidar, acknowledging discrepancies existing between the systems and collected data. We highlight their use and role in validating the relationship between ground and airborne estimates of total LAI (LVIS LAI correlation with i) hemispherical photographs, r2 = 0.80, ii) LAI-2000, r2 = 0.85, and iii) terrestrial lidar, r2 = 0.76. The existence of such relationships offers immediate implications for LAI estimation where LVIS data is available, creating the potential to obtain, not only total LAI values but also corresponding vertical LAI distributions from a ground validated source previously unobtainable at this spatial scale.
The ability to validate airborne lidar LAI data collected at different spatial scales to the available ground measurements allows further upscaled validation using global lidar datasets provided by spaceborne lidar, such as the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS). In the absence of adequate ground validation plots coincident with GLAS footprints, GLAS LAI validation is examined using geographically limited but spatially continuous LVIS data. Under favorable conditions, significantly the absence of slopes greater than {\textasciitilde} 20{\^{A}}$\deg$, the comparison between LVIS and GLAS LAI values obtained using a recursive algorithm constrained by independently validated LAI limits exposes the capability of GLAS as an accurate standalone LAI sensor (r2 = 0.69, bias = {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright} 0.05 and RMSE = 0.33). The correlation comparison between LVIS and GLAS LAI estimates not only significantly exceed those associated with equivalent space borne passive remote sensing datasets, such as MODIS (r2 = 0.20, bias = {\^{a}}{\textasciicircum}{\textquoteright} 0.16 and RMSE = 0.67) but also offers significant advantages to future research including the prospective validation of regional and global LAI products and data comparison with ecosystem model inputs. The encountered effectiveness of these relationships allows the implementation of a scaling-up strategy where ground-based LAI observations are related to aircraft observations of LAI, which in turn are used to validate GLAS LAI derived from coincident data. Successful implementation of this strategy paves the way for the future recovery of vertical LAI profiles on a global scale and opens up the potential for fusion studies to incorporate widely available and spatially abundant passive optical datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {* Models of forest energy, water and carbon cycles assume decreased stomatal conductance with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) based on leaf-scale measurements, a response not directly translatable to canopies. Where canopy--atmosphere are well-coupled, [CO2]-induced structural changes, such as increasing leaf-area index (LD), may cause, or compensate for, reduced mean canopy stomatal conductance (GS), keeping transpiration (EC) and, hence, runoff unaltered.


* We investigated GS responses to increasing [CO2] of conifer and broadleaved trees in a temperate forest subjected to 17-yr free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE; +{~}200{~}$\mu$mol{~}mol$-$1). During the final phase of the experiment, we employed step changes of [CO2] in four elevated-[CO2] plots, separating direct response to changing [CO2] in the leaf-internal air-space from indirect effects of slow changes via leaf hydraulic adjustments and canopy development.


* Short-term manipulations caused no direct response up to 1.8{~}$\times${~}ambient [CO2], suggesting that the observed long-term 21\% reduction of GS was an indirect effect of decreased leaf hydraulic conductance and increased leaf shading. Thus, EC was unaffected by [CO2] because 19\% higher canopy LD nullified the effect of leaf hydraulic acclimation on GS.


* We advocate long-term experiments of duration sufficient for slow responses to manifest, and modifying models predicting forest water, energy and carbon cycles accordingly.},

  Abstract                 = {Free-air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments provide a remarkable wealth of data which can be used to evaluate and improve terrestrial ecosystem models (TEMs). In the FACE model-data synthesis project, 11 TEMs were applied to two decadelong FACE experiments in temperate forests of the southeastern U.S.{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}the evergreen Duke Forest and the deciduous Oak Ridge Forest. In this baseline paper, we demonstrate our approach to model-data synthesis by evaluating the models' ability to reproduce observed net primary productivity (NPP), transpiration, and leaf area index (LAI) in ambient CO2 treatments. Model outputs were compared against observations using a range of goodness-of-fit statistics. Many models simulated annual NPP and transpiration within observed uncertainty. We demonstrate, however, that high goodness-of-fit values do not necessarily indicate a successful model, because simulation accuracy may be achieved through compensating biases in component variables. For example, transpiration accuracy was sometimes achieved with compensating biases in leaf area index and transpiration per unit leaf area. Our approach to model-data synthesis therefore goes beyond goodness-of-fit to investigate the success of alternative representations of component processes. Here we demonstrate this approach by comparing competing model hypotheses determining peak LAI. Of three alternative hypotheses{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}(1) optimization to maximize carbon export, (2) increasing specific leaf area with canopy depth, and (3) the pipe model{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}the pipe model produced peak LAI closest to the observations. This example illustrates how data sets from intensive field experiments such as FACE can be used to reduce model uncertainty despite compensating biases by evaluating individual model assumptions.},

Observed L is compared with: (i) L predicted to optimize net primary productivity for a given average annual temperature, annual water use and potential evaporation (Lopt) and (ii) L calculated as a linear function of climate wetness index (Leq). L peaked in fertilized plots at between 4 and 5 years of age or immediately after canopy closure. The value of L from canopy closure to age 8 years was not strongly related to annual rainfall or climate wetness index. At two sites with total soil nitrogen {\textless}1.2 mg{~}g$-$1, L in fertilized plots was about two units greater than in unfertilized plots. This difference persisted until measurements ended in 2004 when the trees were 8 years old. The L of plots thinned to 300 and 600 stems ha$-$1 at age 2 years recovered quickly and was not significantly different from L in unthinned plots when the trees were 8 years old. Lopt was a good predictor of the leaf area index of 8-year-old plots of E. globulus when nitrogen and phosphorus were non-limiting (model efficiency (EF) was 0.5). For the same plots, Leq underestimated observed L by an average of two units, and the model efficiency was low ($-$3.25). Data from two nitrogen-limited sites demonstrated that for fertilized plots Lopt (EF = 0.6) was a much better predictor of L than Leq (EF = $-$3.36). At the same sites, Leq (EF = 0.42) was a better model for predicting L of unfertilized plots than Lopt ($-$3.59). These results provide evidence that comparing observed L with Lopt can identify stands limited by factors other than growing climate.},

  Abstract                 = {In the dry sclerophyll jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forests of the south-west of Western Australia, measurements of leaf area index (L) are required to study tree growth, water use and mine rehabilitation on typically sparse stands (L = 1{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}2). This study compared three indirect estimators of L{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}sunlight transmittance collected with the DEMON measurement system, hemispherical photography and allometric relationships{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}with the results of a direct measurement (L = 1.05). The estimate of leaf area from the allometric relationship was not significantly different from the direct estimate (P \&gt; 0.20), overestimating L by 9\%. The DEMON system and the hemispherical photography overestimated L by 58\% and 73\%, respectively. These overestimates reduced to 20\% and 32\%, respectively, when the projected area of stems and branches was also considered in the comparison. When logarithmic averaging of the light transmittance was used, the DEMON overestimated L by 132\% and overestimated the projected area of stems, branches and leaves by 77\%. Where seasonal or other small differences in L are studied, techniques based on light transmission may not detect differences in L that are smaller than one. The results from this single plot are inconclusive, and further studies of the performance of hemispherical photography and sunlight transmittance should be made under sparse canopies.},

  Abstract                 = {Real-time/near real-time inversion of land surface biogeophysical variables from satellite observations is required to monitor rapid land surface changes, and provide the necessary input for numerical weather forecasting models and decision support systems. This paper develops a new inversion method for the real-time estimation of the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of land surfaces from MODIS time series reflectance data (MOD09A1). It consists of a series of procedures, including time series data smoothing, data quality control and real-time estimation of LAI. After the historical LAI time series is smoothed by a multi-step Savitzky{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblleft}Golay filter to determine the upper LAI envelope, a Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model is used to derive the LAI climatology. Based on the climatology from the SARIMA model to evolve LAI in time, a dynamic model is then constructed and used to provide the short-range forecast of LAI. Predictions from this model are used with Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) techniques to recursively update biophysical variables as new observations arrive. The validation results produced using MODIS surface reflectance data and field-measured LAI data at eight BELMANIP sites show that the real-time inversion method is able to efficiently produce a relatively smooth LAI product. In addition, the accuracy is significantly improved over the MODIS LAI product.},

However, directly observed relationships between climate and terrestrial CO2 exchange with the atmosphere across biomes and continents are lacking. Here we present data describing the relationships between net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) and climate factors as measured using the eddy covariance method at 125 unique sites in various ecosystems over six continents with a total of 559 site-years. We find that NEE observed at eddy covariance sites is (1) a strong function of mean annual temperature at mid- and high-latitudes, (2) a strong function of dryness at mid- and low-latitudes, and (3) a function of both temperature and dryness around the mid-latitudinal belt (45{\^{A}}$\deg$N). The sensitivity of NEE to mean annual temperature breaks down at {\textasciitilde} 16 {\^{A}}$\deg$C (a threshold value of mean annual temperature), above which no further increase of CO2 uptake with temperature was observed and dryness influence overrules temperature influence.},

  Abstract                 = {While temperature controls on vegetation phenology in humid temperate climates have been widely investigated, water availability is the primary limit on vegetation growth in arid and semiarid ecosystems at continental and global scales. This paper explores the response of vegetation phenology to precipitation across Africa from 2000 to 2003 using vegetation index data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and daily rainfall data obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM). The results indicate that well-defined thresholds exist in cumulative rainfall that stimulate vegetation green-up in arid and semiarid regions of Africa. Therefore cumulative rainfall provides an appropriate criterion for determining the onset of the rainy season, which can be used to predict the onset of vegetation green-up. Following the end of the rainy season, the onset of vegetation dormancy occurs with a lag of about 54 and 84 days in the Sahelian and sub-Sahelian region and in southern Africa, respectively. Further, spatial patterns in vegetation phenology can be divided into three distinct regions in arid and semiarid ecosystems of Africa because of well-defined patterns in rainfall seasonality. In response to rainfall patterns controlled by the Intertropical Convergence Zone in the Sahelian and sub-Sahelian region, the timing of vegetation phenology shifts gradually in a north-south direction at a rate of 0.12 d/km for green-up onset and 0.05 d/km for dormancy onset. In contrast, patterns in vegetation phenology and rainfall seasonality are much more complex in southern Africa. The shift rates and trends in this region are consistent locally but vary abruptly across different ecosystems or climate regimes. Multiple annual cycles of vegetation growth closely follow rainy seasons in parts of the Greater Horn of Africa.},
